# webex

The goal of webex is to enable instructors to easily create web documents that students can use in self-assessment.

## Installation

You can install the released version of webex from [GitHub](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webex) with:

``` r
devtools::install_packages_github("PsyTeachR/webex")
```

The webex package provides a number of functions that you use in [inline R code](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf) to create HTML widgets (text boxes, pull down menus, buttons that reveal hidden content). Examples are provided in the **Web Exercises** R Markdown template. Knit the file to HTML to see how it works.
